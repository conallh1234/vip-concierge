# VIP Concierge Web Application

This is a really simple project that shows the usage of Next.js with TypeScript.

## Business Summary

Our business offers a premium VIP Airport Concierge Service in Perth, Western Australia. We cater to busy travelers who want a seamless experience when flying out of Perth Airport by providing a valet-style solution: customers drive to the terminal, hand over their keys, and our professional team securely stores their vehicle in a nearby facility. Optional detailing services are available during the storage period. Upon return, the vehicle is returned to the customer at the terminal, clean and ready to go.
